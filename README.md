# Simple_Evolution_Stimulation

Originally I want to design a world and build AI to run the world, then I can enjoying being the God of teh world. I got this though when in high school. And finished the outline of the world in my third year in sinior high school. It's about two thousand lines of Java. Containing the basic structure of the world.

Then I wanted to build the AI for the creatures in the world, however I encouter diifculty due to the lack of knowledge about AI. Also my outline is neither neat nor clear. Hence the project is not in active development. Just put it here to record my once poor programming skill and learning path.

But I think I will still try to open up other project to build my own world and realize my God dream lol
